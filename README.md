# Modelling Immune Interactions

This project was carried out as part of my Talented Student Program (TSP) research project under the supervision of Associate Professor Peter Kim.

In this project, an agent-based model was developed to simulate the activity of various types of immune cells in the hope of observing some emergent behaviours that we frequently find in immune responses. This will help us to gain a better understanding of the factors that cause these behaviours and how sensitive these biological systems are to different conditions and parameters.
